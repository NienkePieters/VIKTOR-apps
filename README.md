# container-app
This app can help carriers optimise the load in their containers. It solves the two-dimensional knapsack problem (2D-KP) and has been built using Python and VIKTOR. It is based on the following article: https://towardsdatascience.com/maximize-the-loading-capacity-of-a-sea-container-to-reduce-your-shipping-costs-with-python-8cc02c9725a7

You can select the type of container and the typea/quantity of pallets; the algorithm places them in the container to maximise the amount of pallets, increasing filling rate.

The sea carries more than 80 percent of the world’s traded goods, most of which sail inside 40-foot-long steel containers. Optimising the load in each container can reduce CO2 emissions!
