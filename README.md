# container-app
This app can help carriers optimise the load in their containers. It solves the two-dimensional knapsack problem (2D-KP) and has been built using Python and @VIKTOR. 
You can select the type of container and the typea/quantity of pallets; the algorithm places them in the container to maximise the amount of pallets, increasing filling rate.
